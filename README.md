# Location Tracker Project

This project is a location tracker that uses phone numbers to retrieve location and carrier information. It utilizes the `phonenumbers` library, OpenCageGeocode API, and Folium for mapping.

## Features

- **Phone Number Parsing:** Utilizes the `phonenumbers` library to parse phone numbers.
- **Location Information:** Retrieves location information using the `geocoder` module from `phonenumbers`.
- **Carrier Information:** Retrieves carrier information using the `carrier` module from `phonenumbers`.
- **Map Integration:** Uses Folium to create an interactive map displaying the location.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
